# Bayesian-spatial-models-with-Asthma-ED-visits-in-California-counties
For my Bayesian class final, I evaluated the incorporation of spatial correlation with Poisson model. In GLM framework, modeling the spatial correlation is fairly tricky.

In the R script folder, I stored the R scripts used to run the R2openbugs. The R scripts include the model specification, initicals and model conditions. The model scripts that are called in the R scripts are stored under the Models_saved folder.
